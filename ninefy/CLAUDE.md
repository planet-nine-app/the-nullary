# Ninefy - Digital Goods Marketplace

## Overview

Ninefy is a minimalist digital goods marketplace built on The Nullary ecosystem, designed to facilitate the buying and selling of digital products like ebooks, music, software, courses, templates, and event tickets. It serves as a decentralized alternative to platforms like Gumroad, utilizing Planet Nine's infrastructure for true digital ownership and privacy-focused commerce.

## Architecture

### Core Philosophy
- **Digital Commerce First**: Focused on selling and distributing digital goods
- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Built on allyabase infrastructure for true digital ownership
- **SVG-First UI**: All interface elements use SVG components instead of HTML/CSS
- **Sanora Integration**: Uses Sanora service for product hosting and transactions
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Tauri for desktop deployment across all platforms

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: SVG components with embedded CSS, vanilla JavaScript (no ES6 modules)
- **Backend**: Complete allyabase ecosystem integration (Rust + Tauri)
- **Authentication**: sessionless protocol with secp256k1 cryptographic keys
- **Desktop**: Tauri v2.6.2 framework (Rust + Web) for cross-platform apps
- **Storage**: Full allyabase integration (Sanora for products, Addie for payments) + local storage for caching

### üöÄ Integration Lessons Learned

**Critical Implementation Notes**:

1. **Sanora Function Availability**: The functions `get_all_products()` and `toggle_product_availability()` don't exist in sanora_rs crate - use HTTP calls or extend the crate
2. **Tauri Variable Safety**: Always check `window.__TAURI__` availability and provide fallbacks
3. **JavaScript Module Loading**: Avoid duplicate `let invoke` declarations across files - use global scope sharing
4. **Backend Service Reality**: Build with graceful degradation assuming services may be unavailable
5. **Stripe Integration Pattern**: Follow screenary's proven approach for payment processing

**Development Workflow**:
- ‚úÖ Build works without compilation errors (fixed main.rs import issue)
- ‚úÖ App launches and navigates properly (fixed duplicate variable declaration)
- ‚úÖ Forms work with backend integration (upload to Sanora with fallbacks)
- ‚úÖ Payments initialize correctly (Stripe integration with safety checks)
- ‚úÖ Cross-base browsing functions (HTTP-based product discovery)

### Future Enhancement Opportunities

**Immediate Extensions**:
