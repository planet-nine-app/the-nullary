# Ninefy - Digital Goods Marketplace

## Overview

Ninefy is a minimalist digital goods marketplace built on The Nullary ecosystem, designed to facilitate the buying and selling of digital products like ebooks, music, software, courses, templates, and event tickets. It serves as a decentralized alternative to platforms like Gumroad, utilizing Planet Nine's infrastructure for true digital ownership and privacy-focused commerce.

## Architecture

### Core Philosophy
- **Digital Commerce First**: Focused on selling and distributing digital goods
- **Decentralized Marketplace**: Built on allyabase infrastructure for true digital ownership
- **SVG-First UI**: All interface elements use SVG components instead of HTML/CSS
- **Sanora Integration**: Uses Sanora service for product hosting and transactions
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Tauri for desktop deployment across all platforms

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: SVG components with embedded CSS, vanilla JavaScript (no ES6 modules)
- **Backend**: Complete allyabase ecosystem integration (Rust + Tauri)
- **Authentication**: sessionless protocol with secp256k1 cryptographic keys
- **Desktop**: Tauri v2.6.2 framework (Rust + Web) for cross-platform apps
- **Storage**: Full allyabase integration (Sanora for products, Addie for payments) + local storage for caching

## Development

### Environment Configuration

Ninefy supports three environments for connecting to different allyabase infrastructures:

- **`dev`** - Production dev server (https://dev.*.allyabase.com)
- **`test`** - Local 3-base test ecosystem (localhost:5111-5122)  
- **`local`** - Standard local development (localhost:3000-3007)

#### Environment Switching

**Via Browser Console** (while app is running):
```javascript
// Switch to test ecosystem
ninefyEnv.switch('test')
location.reload()

// Switch to dev server
ninefyEnv.switch('dev') 
location.reload()

// Check current environment
ninefyEnv.current()

// List all environments
ninefyEnv.list()
```

**Via Package Scripts**:
```bash
npm run dev:dev    # Dev server
npm run dev:test   # Test ecosystem  
npm run dev:local  # Local development
```

#### Programming API
```javascript
// Get current environment config
const config = getEnvironmentConfig();
console.log(config.env);        // 'dev', 'test', or 'local'
console.log(config.services);   // Service URLs

// Get specific service URL
const sanoraUrl = getServiceUrl('sanora');
const bdoUrl = getServiceUrl('bdo');
```

### Running the Application

```bash
cd ninefy/ninefy
npm install

# Development with different environments
npm run dev:dev      # Dev server (default)
npm run dev:test     # 3-base test ecosystem
npm run dev:local    # Local development

# Production builds
npm run build:dev    # Build for dev server
npm run build:test   # Build for test ecosystem
npm run build:local  # Build for local
```

### üöÄ Integration Lessons Learned

**Critical Implementation Notes**:

1. **Sanora Function Availability**: The functions `get_all_products()` and `toggle_product_availability()` don't exist in sanora_rs crate - use HTTP calls or extend the crate
2. **Tauri Variable Safety**: Always check `window.__TAURI__` availability and provide fallbacks
3. **JavaScript Module Loading**: Avoid duplicate `let invoke` declarations across files - use global scope sharing
4. **Backend Service Reality**: Build with graceful degradation assuming services may be unavailable
5. **Stripe Integration Pattern**: Follow screenary's proven approach for payment processing

**Development Workflow**:
- ‚úÖ Build works without compilation errors (fixed main.rs import issue)
- ‚úÖ App launches and navigates properly (fixed duplicate variable declaration)
- ‚úÖ Forms work with backend integration (upload to Sanora with fallbacks)
- ‚úÖ Payments initialize correctly (Stripe integration with safety checks)
- ‚úÖ Cross-base browsing functions (HTTP-based product discovery)

### üéØ **Production Readiness Achievements (Latest)**

**Complete Demo Data Removal (January 2025)**:
- ‚úÖ **Removed ALL sample data**: Deleted 200+ lines of SAMPLE_PRODUCTS and TELEPORTED_CONTENT
- ‚úÖ **Professional empty states**: Added "üì¶ No products yet" messages with helpful guidance
- ‚úÖ **Production-ready UX**: Clean interface without confusing demo content

**New Sanora `/products/base` Endpoint Integration**:
- ‚úÖ **Public API endpoint**: Uses new `GET /products/base` for marketplace discovery
- ‚úÖ **No authentication required**: Simplified browsing without user creation
- ‚úÖ **Complete documentation**: Full API docs added to Sanora README
- ‚úÖ **Efficient architecture**: Single call gets ALL products from entire base
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible**: Old user-specific endpoints still available

**Dynamic Base Discovery System**:
- ‚úÖ **BDO-based discovery**: Uses `dev.bdo.allyabase.com` as home base
- ‚úÖ **Intelligent caching**: 10-minute base cache, 5-minute product cache
- ‚úÖ **Removed hardcoded servers**: Dynamic base list from BDO instead of static options
- ‚úÖ **Graceful degradation**: Works offline with helpful error messages
